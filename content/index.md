# My Intro

I'm [Adji](https://linkedin.com/in/adjiarioputro), A technology consulting professional with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) focused in Information Technology from Hochschule Mannheim in Germany with experience as an Operations Engineer and Project Engineer in South East Asia. 
  
Outside of my professional life, I unwind with a good science-fiction or fantasy book, experiment with a new cooking recipe, story-rich computer games and enacting different lives through tabletop role playing games, such as Dungeons and Dragons.

As of 2024, my interest include the following:
- Cooking
- Software Development (Python, PowerShell, Linux)
- Creative Writing
- Game Development (Unity)
- CyberSecurity (Ethical Hacking)
# How did I get started with this?
Ever since a few years ago, a former colleague of mine relayed to me about his use of Obsidian.md for his knowledge management. I was convinced to use it at the beginning, but found it hard to start working with it.

Fast forward to 2022, and I was getting the problem with knowledge that I have attained or trying to build, as I can't seem to find them when I need them. So I thought, "Oh what the heck...let's build it from scratch, the heck with templates and form, and find what works best for me"

I started since then, and my personal Obsidian Vault has been my source of inspiration, knowledge, cheat sheet, and most importantly as Richard Feynman said in his Biography:

# Why am I sharing this?
The same reason why people share their knowledge and tips and tricks on [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/), to help other people. Hence why as well I'm putting the same license on the Repository as all the posts in StackOverflow.
